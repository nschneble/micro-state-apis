# Tiny Irreverent APIs

What are they and why are they clearly awesome?

Tiny Irreverent APIs (TIAPIs) have three founding principles:
1. [They only have a single endpoint](#they-only-have-a-single-endpoint)
1. [They have fixed datasets](#they-have-fixed-datasets)
1. [They're APIs](#theyre-apis)

## They only have a single endpoint

One way in, one way out. Parameters optional.

## They have fixed datasets

No complex databases here. We're talking about stable, concise datasets that don't need to change very often, if at all.

## They're APIs

I hope this part's obvious.

## Examples

U.S. state capitals:

```
https://api.fancyenchiladas.net/capitals?state=ma
# Boston
```

Best Picture Oscar winners:

```
https://api.fancyenchiladas.net/best-picture?2008
# Slumdog Millionaire
```

You could even create a TIAPI that acts like a generator or randomizer!

Pangrams:

```
https://api.fancyenchiladas.net/pangram
# The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

## THIS IS SO AWESOME

I know right? Here's what I imagine a TIAPI looks like:
