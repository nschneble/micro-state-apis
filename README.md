# Tiny Irreverent APIs

What are they and why should you care about them?

## They only have a single endpoint

One way in, one way out. Parameters optional.

## They have fixed datasets

No complex databases here. We're talking about stable, concise datasets that don't need to change very often, if at all.

## They're APIs

I hope this part's obvious.

## Examples

A tiny irreverent api (TIAPI) of US state capitals:

```
https://fancyenchiladas.net/capitals?state=ma
# Boston
```

Best Picture Oscar winners:

```
https://fancyenchiladas.net/best-picture?2008
# Slumdog Millionaire
```

You could even create a TIAPI that acts like a generator or randomizer!

Pangrams:

```

# The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

## Why should you care?

Because they're silly and fun. Here's what I imagine a TIAPI looks like:
